# kodi-burn-after-watching

Deletes certain TV episodes after you've watched them. Useful for daily
quiz shows etc.

It's intended to run in Docker because I can't be bothered to learn Kodi
plugins 🤷

## Usage

Firstly, [tag your TV series](https://kodi.wiki/view/Video_library_tags).
This script only deletes episodes for series with a given tag.

The default tag we look for is "burn-after-watching" but you can use
whatever's convenient.

Now let's deploy it:
